      <h3>Overview: The "Cross-Play" Challenge</h3>

      <p>Let's be real: the gaming world is changing fast. We're moving past the era where you're stuck to one screen. Players today want a <strong>cross-platform journey</strong>—they want to start a session on the bus with their phone and finish it on their PC at home.</p>

      <p>That was the spark for <strong>Games Hub</strong>. We wanted to evolve Bemobi's existing product into a massive <strong>360° Gaming Ecosystem</strong>. My job wasn't just to "make it pretty." I was there to be the <strong>Business Facilitator</strong>. I had to take a complex B2B2C model, a bunch of high-level industry partners, and turn all that "business talk" into a visual story that would make investors actually want to open their wallets.</p>

      ---
      
      <h3>Step 1: Mapping the Ecosystem (The Discovery)</h3>

      <p>Before I even touched a single pixel in Figma, we had to figure out the logic. We were looking at a <strong>white-label orchestration</strong>. How do we bring PC, Console, and Mobile together under one roof?</p>

      <p>I spent my time huddled with the PO and PM, breaking down the <strong>B2B2C architecture</strong>. We weren't just designing for a user; we were designing a value chain for partners and customers alike. It was about making sure the "Gaming Universe" felt like a unified home, not just a folder of random apps.</p>

      </div>

      ---
      
      <h3>Step 2: Naming & Visual "Flavor" (The Definition)</h3>

      <p>Once we knew <em>how</em> it worked, we had to figure out what to call it. Through a few <strong>naming dynamics</strong>, we landed on <strong>"Games Hub"</strong>. It sounds central, powerful, and easy to understand.</p>

      <p>Technically, I had to keep things lean. I used a color-coding system to help users navigate the different platforms instantly: <strong>Yellow for Mobile, Green for Console, and Red for PC</strong>. Since the product was <strong>white-label</strong>, I kept the branding generic enough to be flexible but polished enough to look like a premium, "plug-and-play" solution.</p>

        <img src="../assets/gamesHub/visual-identity.png" alt="Visual identity system for Games Hub, showcasing a color-coded information architecture (Yellow for Mobile, Green for Console, Red for PC) designed for high scannability and white-label flexibility." class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 my-3">
      </div>

      ---
      
      <h3>Step 3: Designing the Pitch (The Iteration)</h3>

      <p>This is where the rubber meets the road. I didn't treat this like a standard <strong>User Flow</strong> exercise; I treated the Landing Page like a <strong>sales pitch on steroids</strong>. </p>

      <p>I went through <strong>five major iterations</strong> of the desktop screens. We were constantly getting "reality checks" from the Commercial Director and other stakeholders. Every time they said, "We need to prove this is viable," I'd go back and tweak the UI to better communicate the business opportunity. I used <strong>high-fidelity mockups</strong> and device-specific imagery to make the "Multi-Platform" dream feel 100% tangible.</p>

      <div id="carouselGamesHub" class="carousel slide carousel-wrapper mb-5" data-bs-ride="carousel">
        <div class="carousel-indicators">
            <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselGamesHub" data-bs-slide-to="0" class="active" aria-current="true" aria-label="Slide 1"></button>
            <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselGamesHub" data-bs-slide-to="1" aria-label="Slide 2"></button>
        </div>

        <div class="carousel-inner">
            <div class="carousel-item active">
                <img src="../assets/gamesHub/version-history-1.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
                <img src="../assets/gamesHub/version-history-2.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselGamesHub" data-bs-slide="prev">
            <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon custom-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            <span class="visually-hidden">Anterior</span>
        </button>
        <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselGamesHub" data-bs-slide="next">
            <span class="carousel-control-next-icon custom-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            <span class="visually-hidden">Próximo</span>
        </button>
    </div>
      
      <h3>Final Artifact: The "Successful" Pivot</h3>

      <p>So, what was the result? We ended up with a gorgeous, high-fidelity prototype that perfectly captured the <strong>Games Hub</strong> vision. </p>

      <p>But here's the kicker: the project didn't actually launch. After all our pitches and diagrams, the commercial "math" just didn't add up for the investors at that time. </p>

      <p>In a lot of portfolios, people only talk about their wins. But for me, this was a <strong>strategic victory</strong>. My work served as a <strong>deciding factor</strong>. By "tangibilizing" the idea quickly, I helped the company validate a business direction without spending a fortune on actual development. I learned that as a designer, my biggest value is <strong>facilitating understanding</strong>—helping a business see its own ideas clearly enough to decide whether to go all-in or pivot.</p>
