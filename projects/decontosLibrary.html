        <p>Descontos is a powerful white-label product for Bemobi that needs to act as a total chameleon to adapt to various clients, so scalability is really the top priority. I developed this strategic design proposal to build a high-level DesignOps structure that ensures every new implementation is fast and consistent while maintaining system integrity. Even though shifting budget priorities meant the project did not move into the development phase, the entire study stands as a comprehensive vision for a superior and more scalable user experience that serves as a master blueprint for the design team.</p>

        <h3>Discover: Systematizing the whitelabel foundations</h3>
        <p>Every client has their own launcher icon and splash screen and specific branding like colors and fonts. In the beginning this was all over the place. I took all these scattered elements and systematized them into this final library. I used Figma Variables to organize everything from the basic colors to the specific typography and text styles for each partner. This way we could manage the look and feel for each client in a very organized way without breaking the system. It was all about creating a solid foundation that could handle any brand identity thrown at it.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Screenflow: Mapping the experience from scratch</h3>
        <p>Before I even started building components I had to map the entire product from the ground up. I documented every single page along with all the possible variations and specific behaviors for each feature. I drew this entire map for both desktop and mobile versions to make sure we didn't miss a single step in the user journey. Once this map was finished I incorporated it directly into the final library artifact. This gives any designer using the file a perfect bird's eye view of how the product actually works before they even start designing.</p>

        <h3>Define: DesignOps as the internal engine</h3>
        <p>During the definition phase, the focus was on proactively componentizing a robust library for the 'Descontos' product, using the 'Ads' stream as a lever to apply Atomic Design principles and document UI improvements across the ecosystem. As part of an internal <strong>DesignOps initiative</strong>, we established a unified visual structure for Figma file covers, where even the specific shade of green was strategically chosen to distinguish 'Descontos' assets from other Bemobi projects. Every element of these covers—including titles, imagery, status tags, and team members—underwent multiple studies and iterations to streamline the design process and mature the overall Design construction within the Bemobi team.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Develop: High-end Figma Engineering</h3>
        <p>I really leaned into the more advanced features of Figma to make this library feel premium. I built everything using Auto-layout and used Component Properties to keep our layers clean. Instead of having dozens of versions for a single card I created smart components that could be toggled and tweaked easily. This technical approach meant that any designer on the team could pick up the library and build a complex interface without ever having to struggle with broken layouts or manual resizing.</p>

        <h3>Methodology: The power of Atomic Design</h3>
        <p>To keep everything organized I followed the Atomic Design methodology proposed by Brad Frost. I structured the library starting from the smallest Atoms like buttons and icons and moved up to Molecules and Organisms. This hierarchical way of thinking allowed us to build complex sections of the product while knowing that every single piece was connected to a master style. It made the entire library feel like a modular kit where everything just fits together perfectly and stays consistent no matter how big the project gets.</p>

        <h3>Templates vs Pages: The Execution Strategy</h3>
        <p>One of the most interesting parts of this project was how I separated the high-level structures. I created a set of Templates that acted as the skeleton of the product and these were built using simple images and placeholder text to show the layout. Then I created a separate layer for Pages. These pages were actually different components that used the templates as their base but they allowed designers to override the content with realistic images and actual copy. This workflow was a game changer because it let us test real scenarios and mockups while keeping the underlying structure totally intact.</p>

          <img src="..\assets\descontosLibrary\templatesXPages.png" alt="A side-by-side comparison showing a structural Template with placeholders and the final Page component with realistic content and overrides." class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 my-3">
        </div>

        <h3>Design Proposal Table: Speaking the language of product</h3>
        <p>To bridge the gap between design vision and product management I created a Design Proposal Table. This was my main tool for arguing in favor of the project with POs and PMs. I mapped out the current state of the product versus the proposed new version and I added a column for UX Reasons. In this column I used data and heuristics to explain exactly why each change would improve user satisfaction and conversion. This artifact transformed a simple visual update into a documented business case making it much easier to show the tangible value of our design work.</p>

          <img src="..\assets\descontosLibrary\designProposalTable.png" alt="A screenshot of the comparison table showing the 'Before', 'New', and 'UX Reasons' columns with detailed annotations." class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 my-3">
        </div>

        <h3>Final Artifact: Lessons in Resilience</h3>
        <p>At the end of the day the Descontos library became a high-performance engine that is fully documented and ready for action. Even though the product didn't go live due to external budget shifts I consider this a major win for our design culture.</p>
        <p>The biggest lesson here? Sometimes a designer's job is to build the future even if the present isn't ready for it yet. I learned that having a solid argument and a clear systematic process is just as important as the pixels themselves. So while these screens might not be in the hands of millions of users right now they are in the hands of our design team making them faster and sharper every day. And hey if the budget ever opens up we are already 10 steps ahead and ready to launch!</p>
