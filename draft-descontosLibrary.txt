PROJECT TITLE: Descontos Product Library SUBTITLE: A Strategic Design Proposal for Bemobi’s White-Label Ecosystem

NOTE: This project was developed as a comprehensive design and UX proposal. While the structural improvements and the new library didn't reach the development phase due to shifting budget priorities, the entire study was built to showcase a vision for a superior and more scalable user experience.

PROJECT DETAILS Duration: 4 months Role: Lead UI/UX Designer and DesignOps Specialist Team: 1 Product Manager, 1 UX Researcher, Design Team Deliverables: Atomic Design System, Screenflow Map, Design Proposal Table, Figma Library

OVERVIEW In the world of digital services scalability is the name of the game. Descontos is the commercial name for a powerful white-label product I worked on for Bemobi. Since this product was built to be sold and adapted to various different clients the design needed to be a total chameleon. My challenge was to create a library that was robust enough to maintain its integrity but flexible enough to change its skin for every new brand. I focused on building a high-level DesignOps structure that acted as a silent partner for the design team making sure that every new client implementation was fast and consistent.

1. DISCOVER: SYSTEMATIZING THE WHITE-LABEL FOUNDATIONS Every client has their own launcher icon and splash screen and specific branding like colors and fonts. In the beginning this was all over the place. I took all these scattered elements and systematized them into this final library. I used Figma Variables to organize everything from the basic colors to the specific typography and text styles for each partner. This way we could manage the look and feel for each client in a very organized way without breaking the system. It was all about creating a solid foundation that could handle any brand identity thrown at it.

2. SCREENFLOW: MAPPING THE EXPERIENCE FROM SCRATCH Before I even started building components I had to map the entire product from the ground up. I documented every single page along with all the possible variations and specific behaviors for each feature. I drew this entire map for both desktop and mobile versions to make sure we didn't miss a single step in the user journey. Once this map was finished I incorporated it directly into the final library artifact. This gives any designer using the file a perfect bird's eye view of how the product actually works before they even start designing.

3. DEFINE: DESIGNOPS AS THE INTERNAL ENGINE Since the development team was tied up with budget constraints I pivoted the strategy to focus entirely on internal excellence. I established a DesignOps framework that would make our Figma files a single source of truth for the designers. This was all about creating a system where the design team could work with total autonomy and precision. We stopped reinventing the wheel for every new client and started using a centralized engine that made our daily work much more fluid.

4. DEVELOP: HIGH-END FIGMA ENGINEERING I really leaned into the more advanced features of Figma to make this library feel premium. I built everything using Auto-layout and used Component Properties to keep our layers clean. Instead of having dozens of versions for a single card I created smart components that could be toggled and tweaked easily. This technical approach meant that any designer on the team could pick up the library and build a complex interface without ever having to struggle with broken layouts or manual resizing.

5. METHODOLOGY: THE POWER OF ATOMIC DESIGN To keep everything organized I followed the Atomic Design methodology proposed by Brad Frost. I structured the library starting from the smallest Atoms like buttons and icons and moved up to Molecules and Organisms. This hierarchical way of thinking allowed us to build complex sections of the product while knowing that every single piece was connected to a master style. It made the entire library feel like a modular kit where everything just fits together perfectly and stays consistent no matter how big the project gets.

6. TEMPLATES VS. PAGES: THE EXECUTION STRATEGY One of the most interesting parts of this project was how I separated the high-level structures. I created a set of Templates that acted as the skeleton of the product and these were built using simple images and placeholder text to show the layout. Then I created a separate layer for Pages. These pages were actually different components that used the templates as their base but they allowed designers to override the content with realistic images and actual copy. This workflow was a game changer because it let us test real scenarios and mockups while keeping the underlying structure totally intact.

7. DESIGN PROPOSAL TABLE: SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF PRODUCT To bridge the gap between design vision and product management I created a Design Proposal Table. This was my main tool for arguing in favor of the project with POs and PMs. I mapped out the current state of the product versus the proposed new version and I added a column for UX Reasons. In this column I used data and heuristics to explain exactly why each change would improve user satisfaction and conversion. This artifact transformed a simple visual update into a documented business case making it much easier to show the tangible value of our design work.

8. FINAL ARTIFACT: LESSONS IN RESILIENCE (AND GREAT DESIGN) At the end of the day the Descontos library became a high-performance engine that is fully documented and ready for action. Even though the product didn't go live due to external budget shifts I consider this a major win for our design culture.

The biggest lesson here? Sometimes a designer's job is to build the future even if the present isn't ready for it yet. I learned that having a solid argument and a clear systematic process is just as important as the pixels themselves. So while these screens might not be in the hands of millions of users right now they are in the hands of our design team making them faster and sharper every day. And hey if the budget ever opens up we are already 10 steps ahead and ready to launch!
